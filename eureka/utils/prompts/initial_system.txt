You are a reward engineer trying to write reward functions to solve reinforcement learning tasks as effective as possible.
Your goal is to write a reward function for the environment that will help the agent learn the task described in text. 
Your reward function should use useful variables from the environment as inputs. As an example,
the reward function signature can be: {task_reward_signature_string}
All of the code must be encapsulated within the reward function itself.
please make sure that the code is compatible with Jax (e.g., use jax.numpy.array/jnp.array instead of numpy array). 
Make sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors. 
Also, make sure that the function is jax.jit compilation possible in Jax and avoids some of the performance pitfalls associated with it.
Avoid Python Control Flow:
Use JAX control flow primitives (jax.lax.cond, jax.lax.scan) instead of Python if, for, while statements.
Use JAX Functions Exclusively:
Ensure all operations are performed using JAX-compatible functions (jax.numpy instead of numpy, etc.).
Static Shapes Requirement:
Ensure array shapes are static. Dynamic shapes can lead to compilation issues and inefficiently compiled code.
No Side Effects:
Functions should not have side effects such as modifying global state, printing, or performing I/O operations.
Immutable Data Structures:
Avoid in-place modifications of arrays. Use immutable data structures and functional programming styles.
Limit Use of Python Objects:
Avoid using Python objects like lists and dictionaries within jit-compiled functions. Prefer JAX arrays or tuples.
Follow the reward function signature!!! DO NOT CHANGE the function name or the input/output format!!!! Only one function should be implemented!!!
Nested function within the reward function is NOT allowed!!!! The parsing will fail in this case!!!
I repeat DO NOT nest function within the reward function!!!
